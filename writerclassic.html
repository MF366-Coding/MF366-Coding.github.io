                    <p class="lead">For the executable version of WriterClassic, you will need Windows 10 or later. While WriterClassic might work on older versions of Windows, I can only guarantee full compatibility and support for Windows 10 and later. Additionally, please note that the supported architectures for the executable version are x64, ia64, and amd64.</p>
                    <p class="lead">As WriterClassic is a one-man project, I also offer a portable version with the same features and functionalities as the installer version. The portable version provides the convenience of running WriterClassic directly from a portable storage device without the need for installation. It's a great option for users who prefer a portable and self-contained solution for their text editing needs.</p>

                    <h3 class="mb-3">Internet Features</h3>
                    <p class="lead">In WriterClassic, I've designed a feature that allows users to seamlessly search online directly from the text editor itself. Even if your web browser isn't open, WriterClassic will take care of launching it for you. This capability is achieved using the <code>simple_webbrowser</code> tool, which I developed (MF366), in conjunction with Python's built-in <code>webbrowser</code> module.</p>
                    <p class="lead">What's more, besides just searching, you have the convenience of navigating directly to specific URLs. I've taken the initiative to incorporate various well-known search engines, music services, forums, and information sources right into WriterClassic:</p>

                    <h3 class="mb-3">Default Plugins</h3>
                    <p class="lead">WriterClassic comes with a selection of default plugins to enhance your experience (excluding those found in the <b>Plugin Central</b>).</p>
                    <p class="lead">Included in this package are:</p>
                    <ul class="fa-ul">
                        <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i><b>Notes:</b>

                    <p class="lead">These plugins are seamlessly integrated into WriterClassic, enhancing your workflow with a range of convenient tools.</p>
                    <h3 class="mb-3">Custom Plugins</h3>
                    <p class="lead">This is where WriterClassic becomes more complex.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The plugins are made in Python and must be placed inside the <code>plugins/name_of_your_plugin/</code> folder.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Below is a guide on how to use Custom plugins, the installation feature and the <b>Run a Plugin</b> feature.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Using built-in plugin installation</h4>
                    <p class="lead">This function gathers the official verified and accepted plugins from GitHub, downloads them and extracts them.</p>     
                    <p class="lead">How do you use this function, you might be wondering? It’s simple. First go to <b>Plugins</b>, <b>Install a Plugin</b> and then you’ll see a dialog box asking you for an input.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Just type the <b>name of the folder of the plugin you want to install</b>.</p>
                    <p class="lead">This is the hardest part: you need to <b>go to</b> <a href="https://bit.ly/writerclassic-plugins" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/writerclassic-plugins</a>. There, <b>look at the folders</b>. <b>The name of the folder that has the plugin you want to install is what you need to type in the dialog box.</b></p>
                    <p class="lead"><b>For example:</b> if you wanted to use Norb’s GetHash plugin, you’d type <code>Norb-GetHash</code>, because that is the name of the folder where the plugin is.</p>
                    <p class="lead">After clicking OK, you’ll get prompted about which version of the plugin you’d like to install. For most cases, you’d want to go with the latest (which is also the default).</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Running an already installed plugin</h4>
                    <p class="lead">To run a plugin you have installed, follow this steps: <>go to the folder where you installed WriterClassic</b>. This depends <b>a lot on which version you have installed</b> (Python/Portable/Setup). When you find the directory, <b>go inside</b> <code>plugins</code> and then <b>you’ll see folder(s) named</b> <code>plugin_X</code> where X is a integer.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The plugin you installed is on one of those folders. That X integer is the number of the plugin you want to run (let’s say the number is 6, for this example).</p>
                    <p class="lead">Now, the rest is easy.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Just go to <b>Plugins</b>, and click <b>Run a Plugin</b>. When a dialog box asks you for input, you must type the X number (in this example, 6).</p>
                    <p class="lead">Boom! It’s done!</p>
                    <h3 class="mb-3">Developer options</h3>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Markdown Preview</h4>
                    <p class="lead">Easily preview the Markdown file you're currently working on. WriterClassic will create a temporary HTML copy of your Markdown and open it for you. To use this feature, navigate to <b>Developer</b> and select <b>Markdown Preview</b>.</p>
                    <p class="subheading text-primary"><b>Note for Linux Users:</b> In some cases, Linux users may encounter a PermissionError while attempting to open the temporary HTML file. In such situations, you can manually access it at <code>writerclassic_path/temp</code>.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Build and Run Your Code</h4>
                    <p class="subheading text-primary"><b>Note:</b> Although not explicitly labeled, this feature is currently in BETA. You can choose between C# or Python.</p>
                    <ul style="list-style: none;">
                        <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> <b style="text-transform: uppercase;"> Build Code</b></li>
                        <li style="list-style: none;">To access the Build option, navigate to <b>Developer</b>. Under this menu, you'll find two options: <b>Build Code</b> and <b>Run Code</b>. For now, let's focus on <b>Build Code</b>.</li>
                        <li>
                            <ol style="list-style: none;">
                                <li><b>C#</b> - Clicking on this option leverages Microsoft's <b>.NET</b> to automatically compile your C# code using the <code>dotnet build</code> command. Note that this applies only to saved *.cs or *.csproj files.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> <b style="text-transform: uppercase;"> Run Code</b></li>
                        <li style="list-style: none;">Next, let's explore the <b>Run Code</b> option.</li>
                        <li>
                            <ol style="list-style: none;">
                                <li><b>C#</b> - Similar to the Build option, this utilizes <b>.NET</b>. However, it runs the compiled code using <code>dotnet run</code>.</li>
                                <li><b>Python</b> - This option employs its own command (<code>python path_to_the_file</code>) to execute the Python code. Ensure the file is saved as *.py.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

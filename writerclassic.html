However, it is expected to work on MacOS as well. If you encounter any issues on MacOS or any other OS, your feedback and support are highly appreciated as it helps improve the project's compatibility.</p>

                    <p class="lead">For the executable version of WriterClassic, you will need Windows 10 or later. While WriterClassic might work on older versions of Windows, I can only guarantee full compatibility and support for Windows 10 and later. Additionally, please note that the supported architectures for the executable version are x64, ia64, and amd64.</p>
                    <p class="lead">As WriterClassic is a one-man project, I also offer a portable version with the same features and functionalities as the installer version. The portable version provides the convenience of running WriterClassic directly from a portable storage device without the need for installation. It's a great option for users who prefer a portable and self-contained solution for their text editing needs.</p>
